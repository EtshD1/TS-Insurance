# TS Insurance Company
A simulation for a basic Insurance Company using Redux, and TypeScript. This project is primarily a practice for Redux and TypeScript.
## Getting Started
After cloning this repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies. Make sure to have Node.js installed.
Once all packages are installed you can execute
```bash
npm run dev
```
to run dev mode.
If you want to run the application, you need first to build it by executing
```bash
npm run build
```
you can simply start the app afterward by running `npm start`.

If you would like to see different results, you can edit the dispatches by the end of the [index.ts](./src/index.ts) file.
## Inspiration
I was motivated to write more clean code and have fewer bugs on production, therefor [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) was the perfect tool to use for such a goal.
I also wanted to practice Redux more so I decided to recreate this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sjMRS1gJys) using TypeScript.
### Extra
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM) helped me get motivated to use TypeScript for my future projects.
